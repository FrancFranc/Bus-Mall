The marketing research team

  The app's purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.  The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown.




The developer

  The developer has to build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side) and need to manage the size and the aspect ratio of the images and perhaps edit them a bit.  Finally he need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations, for statistical purposes.



The focus group participant

  The app's purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.  They are not allowed to be shown any results until there have been a total of 25 selections made.
